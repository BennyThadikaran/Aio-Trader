# Aio-Trader

An Async library for accessing Indian stockbroker API and real-time market feeds. 

Currently supports only Zerodha Kite (KiteConnect and Kite Web)

This Library is currently in Alpha. Expect breaking changes. Once testing is complete, I will release a pip package, and begin work on adding other brokers.

**Supports python 3.8+**

If you ‚ù§Ô∏è  my work so far, please üåü this repo.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/Aio-Trader/wiki) is regularly updated with code examples and recipes.

## Installation

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/Aio-Trader.git

cd aio_trader
```

**2. Create a virtual env using `venv` and activate it.**

```bash
py -m venv .

source bin/activate

# On Windows, run the below to activate venv
.\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**3. Install aio_trader**

```bash
pip install .
```

## Kite API usage

**Kite Web login (via interactive user input)** - Requires user_id, password and twofa.
To avoid interactive inputs, pass full or partial info to `kite.authorize`. Any missing information will require user input.

```python
# Kite Web Login Example 1
from aio_trader.kite import Kite
import asyncio


async def main():
    async with Kite() as kite:
        # Starts an interactive prompt for Kite Web login
        await kite.authorize()

        # Kite Web tokens are stored in cookies and reused on subsequent runs
        print(kite.enctoken)


asyncio.run(main())
```

When using a library like [pyotp](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp), pass the function, to `kite.authorize` as below.

```python
import pyotp

totp = pyotp.TOTP('base32secret3232')
# totp.now() to get OTP

async with Kite() as kite:
    await kite.authorize(
        user_id=config["user_id"],
        password=config["password"],
        twofa=totp.now,
    )
```

**KiteConnect Login** - Requires api_key, request_token and api_secret.

```python
async with Kite(api_key=config['api_key']) as kite:
    await kite.authorize(
        request_token=config['request_token'],
        secret=config['secret']
    )

    # Can be stored and reused on subsequent runs
    print(kite.access_token)
```

## Kite Websocket usage

```python
from aio_trader.kite import KiteFeed
from aio_trader import utils
from typing import List
import asyncio


# Define handlers
def on_tick(tick: List, binary=False):
    print(tick)


def on_connect(kws: KiteFeed):
    print("connected")

    # Subscribe to Aarti Industries
    asyncio.create_task(kws.subscribe_symbols([1793]))


async def cleanup(kws):
    # perform clean up operations here
    await kws.close()


async def main():
    enctoken = "STORED_ENCTOKEN"
    user_id = "KITE_WEB_USER_ID"

    async with KiteFeed(
        user_id=user_id,
        enctoken=enctoken,
    ) as kws:
        kws.on_tick = on_tick
        kws.on_connect = on_connect

        # Handle KeyboardInterupt
        utils.add_signal_handlers(cleanup, kws)

        # No code executes after this line
        await kws.connect()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Another example without `asyncio.run`

```python
kws = KiteFeed(
    user_id=user_id,
    enctoken=enctoken,
)

kws.on_tick = on_tick
kws.on_connect = on_connect

# Handle KeyboardInterupt
utils.add_signal_handlers(cleanup, kws)

kws.run_forever()  # No code will run after this line
```

## Differences between Aio-Trader and pykiteconnect(KiteConnect Official library)

| aio-trader | pykiteconnect |
|---|---|
| Uses aiohttp | Uses Twisted, an event-driven framework |
| Supports Python version 3.8+ | Supports Python version 2 & 3 |

Aio-Trader has fewer dependencies owing to its Python support.

KiteFeed uses the [python struct module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) to parse binary data. It tries to unpack all values in a single function call, which is slightly more efficient.

You can also bypass parsing binary data if you want to use a custom parser.

```python
kws = KiteFeed(parse_data=False)
```

Another use case is to forward the data to the browser and parse it client-side. It avoids the overhead of serializing and deserializing the data.
